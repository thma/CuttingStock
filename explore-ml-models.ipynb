    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "By looking at the chart I recommend to choose AdaBoost as the model to go ahead with. Here is why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the decision tree (DT) model has a very high F-score on the training subset but on the actual testing set its F-score is much smaller. This is an indication of an overfitting model. It seems the DT just \"memorizes\" all data points of the training subset but is not able to predict well against the testing set. It does not generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) model has the F-score for training and testing set on the same level. But it is not much better than the performance of the naive predictor (dashed horizontal line). So NB won't help us to give reliable predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The AdaBoost (AB) model also has F-score for training and testing set on the same level. But the F-score is much better than the naive predictor score (dashed horizontal line). So we can conclude that the NB model does not overfit and will be a good starting point to further improvements to reach an even better F-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The AdaBoost training process selects only those features known to improve the predictive power of the model, reducing dimensionality. This will be helpful in our case where we have over 100 input features.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The execution time for AdaBoost is significantly higher for both training and testing. For CharitityML we'll need a model with a high precision. That is if we predict a person to be in the >50K class it better should actually be in this class to avoid costs for sending out mailings to people who are not in the actual target group. \n",
    "    So if we choose AdaBoost with its higher CPU costs we still save overall as we can avoid costly mailings to the wrong candidates.\n",
    "    With further optimizations AdaBoost will also allow to reduce the execution time in many cases."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
